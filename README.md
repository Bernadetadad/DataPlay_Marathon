# Marathon Data Analysed

Analysis of my marathon run data.

The final data visual is made with R + Illustrator.

See the [MarathonAnalysis](MarathonAnalysis.md) file for the code and intermediate steps in the analysis process.

The code is not very "clean" - this is my learning process and always a work in progress.
